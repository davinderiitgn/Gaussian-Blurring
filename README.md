# Gaussian-Blurring

This is an Implementation of blurring using Gaussian Filters and Difference of Gaussian Filters without using any inbuilt function in the opencv library.

1. Gaussian_blur.py - Implenetation of Gaussian Filter
2. DOG.py - Difference of Gaussian Filters

Note- The convolution is implemented (and was intended to be implemented) without using any inbuilt function and as a result is very slow.
      To get faster results one could used inbuilt functions to convolve an image.
